# Spotify Clone
- Dynamic, Responsive Website
- Fetch Songs locally
- Songs appear by, which playlist is selected.
- Can select different songs, play, pause, change time, prev, next, volume bar
    - Nice effects, styling on it
    - Added some extra minor things on it like: Pause the song, while slider is on hold
- Volume image, changing dynamically, according to volume: Like Windows 11

 
## What to add now?
- User can create playlist, add songs in it too from directly website
- Keys: Like the functions would also work using directly typing its corresponding keys
- When clicking on volume icon, volume get mute(/unmute accordingly)


## Issues to fix
- When playing a song, and then chaning the playlist and then reverting back, the song selected color reverts back to normal
- - If a song is in multiple playlist, even after changing to another playlist, if that song is there, it should have selected color(,marking it as playing)
